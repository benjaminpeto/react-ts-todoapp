# Simple To Do App with React and TypeScript

This project was a practice to get my head around TypeScript in React.
I learnt how to use types, interfaces, methods and hooks. Still a lot to learn...

## Tech Stack

  - React
  - TypeScript
  - React-icons
  - react-beautiful-dnd

## Bugs

  Currently on the main branch the project uses the latest (18.0.1) React library, which is not supported yet for the react-beautiful-dnd, and the drag and drop feature didn't work as expected.
  After some consideration I had to downgrade the version of React to 17.0.2 which you can find on the other branch with its respective name. This version of the app runs smoothly without that bug.
